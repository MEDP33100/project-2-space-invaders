## **Project Members**

Maxim Tyan, Samantha Stokes, Bryan Briones

## **Link to Live Page**

_Include a link to the live version of the project hosted on Glitch._

## **Project Overview**

A website to show and filter the different asteroids by size and distance relative to Earth.

## **Features**

Lists closest and fathest asteroids, smallest and largest, as well as the top 100 "near" Earth asteroids, with a display at the top to show relative distance in an animation when the asteroid is clicked on. Clicking off the names would reset the animation. Furthermore, users can flip through pages of 10 asteroids at a time when checking out the top 100 NEAs and a legend on the top right corner displays information on what the color coding represents distance-wise.

## **Technologies Used**

- HTML/Handlebars, CSS, and Javascript: Code and styling for the site.
- Express.js: Running the site on a local server.
- Glitch: Hosting.
- VSCode: Text editor.
- GitHub: Storing and sharing files within the group.

## **Future Enhancements**

- Visualization for asteroid sizes.
- A feature to display an image of the asteroid the user clicks on (when applicable).
